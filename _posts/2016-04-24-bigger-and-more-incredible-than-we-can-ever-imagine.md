# Psalm 19

### The heavens declare the glory of God;

### And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands

And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands 

Day after day they pour forth speech;

night after night they reveal knowledge.

They have no speech, they use no words;

no sound is heard from them.
