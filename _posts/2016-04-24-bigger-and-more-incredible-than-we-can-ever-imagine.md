You're here! Welcome. What is this website all about? **[It's about concepts and presuppositions. ][0]**By what authority? No other higher authority exists than this one. I AM. 

# [Psalm 19][1]

### The heavens declare the glory of God;

### And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands

And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands

Day after day they pour forth speech;

night after night they reveal knowledge.

_They have no speech, they use no words;_

_no sound is heard from them._
