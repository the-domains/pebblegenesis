# [Psalm 19 ][1]

### The heavens declare the glory of God;

### And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands

And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands

Day after day they pour forth speech;

night after night they reveal knowledge.

_They have no speech, they use no words;_

_no sound is heard from them._
