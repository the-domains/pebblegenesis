But it is a gift from the Highest that the word can reveal the power and glory of centrality of Jesus Christ being everything to all of life.

He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.

He is the way, the truth and the life. As a consequence of this revelation, our life is all about Him.
