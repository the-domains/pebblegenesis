## A gift from the Highest that the word can reveal the power and glory of centrality of Jesus Christ being everything to all of life.

# He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.

# He is the way, the truth and the life. As a consequence of this revelation, our life is all about Him.
