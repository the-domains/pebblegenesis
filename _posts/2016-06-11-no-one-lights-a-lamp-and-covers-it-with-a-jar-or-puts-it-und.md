# Transformation begins in the mind being enlightened. 

# A connection happens when our eyes are opened.

# We proclaim this glory is the transforming power of our lives.

## Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
