# Transformation begins in the mind being enlightened. It is a work of the Spirit laying down a foundation of grace and mercy. So man can not boast.

# A connection happens when our eyes are opened.

# We proclaim this glory is the transforming power of our lives.

## Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
