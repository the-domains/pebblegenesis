For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. So profound are these few verses about spiritual light and blindness. Beginning with this section http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-3.htm'
